## Features

* Support the horizontal scrolling of wide content, such as tabular data, in compact views
* Presently targeting macOS v11+ and iOS v14+\*
* No external dependencies!

## Sideways Examples

Excerpt from use with `List`:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Sideways

struct ContentView: View {

    var body: some View {
        List {
            Text("üçá Pinot Noir")
            Text("üçá Cabernet Sauvignon")
            Text("üçá Shiraz")
            Text("üçá Zinfandel")
            Text("üçá Gamay noir")
            Text("üçá Grenache")
            Text("üçá Cabernet Franc")
            Text("üçá Merlot")
        }
        .sideways(minWidth: 100)
    }
}
```

...where `minWidth` is the narrowest width to constrain your content. It can be narrower (or wider) than the view width available.

You can also use as a view wrapper:

```swift
var body: some View {
    Sideways(minWidth: 400) {
        List {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

Or an excerpt from use with _TablerList_...

```swift
var body: some View {
    TablerList(header: header,
               row: row,
               results: fruits)
        .sideways(minWidth: 400)
}
```
